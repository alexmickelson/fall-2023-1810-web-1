                At Snow, we know that there is more to college life than what happens in the classroom. After class is
                done, there are many options for recreation. We are just minutes away from incredible 4-wheeling,
                hiking, and biking trails. The great outdoors not your thing? That’s okay. We have tons of activities
                for you too. Dances, student clubs, service opportunities, sporting events, and did we mention free food
                nights? They are all part of our student life activities.
